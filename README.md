# Henry comments 13/April
- You have a good number of commits so far for around a Credit.
- license file is a GIT license. You need a licenses.txt file to credit any external code/images/sounds you use.
- In your changelog, make sure you put the author at the end of each line in square brackets []
- Do not hardwire any game constants. E.g. "Boar: Health = 25; Attack = 7; Defence = 5;" .. these should all be in an external text file (e.g. a .json file). No numbers/details/gameplay scenarios/levels/etc should be in game code. Always in external game data files (text files).
